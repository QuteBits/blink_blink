Hackathon project (13-14.06.2015): Reconstructing basic 3D model from the ultra sound measurements using Intel Edison. Final setup included breadboard and Arduino Uno (playing a role of a driver for the ultra sound sensor). The 3D scanner managed to scan appr. 200 points (16x12) in about 15 seconds.

- crashed XDE so hard it wouldn't stop complaining after Edison flash and XDK reinstallation.
